Design and Analysis of Algorithms
Compilation:

-> Within the root directory,

    g++ Paper_Number\paper_name.cpp -o exec -Ofast

Running:

-> Place all the dataset in the dataset folder

-> Within the root directory,

    ./exec

Data Preprocessing:
Remove the lines which have start with '#'. And replace the line with the (number of nodes)'\t'(number of edges), followed by the rest of the file.

Example for the Email-Enron:

    36692   367662
    0	1
    1	0
    1	2
    1	3
    1	4
    1	5
